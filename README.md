## FLOATING SCRAP COLLECTOR (FLOSCO)

This repository contains the code base for the mobile and server side of the Floating Scrap Collector game.

The goal of this video game is to help people understand the importance of eliminating space debris that is currently orbiting the earth and help eliminate it in an entertaining and educational way.

This repository contains the code base for a lightweight web server built in [Node JS](https://nodejs.org) which will help us process the data provided by the [Spacebirds web-app](https://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/spacebirds) web page which serves as the basis for creating the missions of the game. This repository also contains the code base for the mobile application (the video game), developed in [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) framework.
